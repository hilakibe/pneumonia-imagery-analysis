Pneumonia Radiologist Assistant is a mobile application designed to help in analysis pneumonia radiographs, generate radiological reports and gives general and useful information about pneumonia.
ISLAMABAD: World Health Organization (WHO) has claimed that pneumonia accounts for 15% of all deaths of children under five years old, killing 808,694 only in year 2017 across the globe.
According to WHO report, pneumonia is the single largest infectious cause of death in children worldwide affecting children and families everywhere, but is most prevalent in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa [1].
In Kenya there is an acute shortage of radiologists. Most rural and remote hospitals with x-ray departments do not have radiologists to report on plain film radiographs. Plain film radiographs are sent to national, provisional, referral and academic institutions for radiological reports. (Rugut Daniel, MTech (Radiography) and Jennifer Motto, MTech (Education), 2017).
The number of patients has overstretched the small number of available radiologist (May, Martino & Mc Elveny, 2008: e24). This often results in delay in the treatment of very sick patients. By the year 2008, Kenya had only 248 radiologists and radiologist-patient ratio was 1:400,000 people (Andronikou, Hugh, Abdurahman, Khoury, Mngomezulu, Brant, Cowan, Culloch & Ford, 2010: 2081-8).
In deed Pneumonia Radiologist Assistant System will be very useful since it will act as a supplement for the acute shortage of radiologist, produce more accurate radiological reports, reduce time wastage, improve radiological service accessibility and creating awareness to the its users about the dangers of pneumonia and how to mitigate and combat it. With the help of artificial intelligence through Pneumonia Radiologist Assistant, pneumonia will be able to be combated with the appropriate attention it deserves.
